# Data-Visualization
Proj3.
Interactive VTK program to exploree iso-surfaces of a volume data set.

Users can interactively define iso-value using a slider (VTK  Slider widget).
 
Program has been tested on :
1. The CT  Head dataset
2. A 100^3 sampling data set of the quadratic functions x^2 + 0:65y^2 +     0:25z^2 + 0:1xz + 0:2x.

Use the slider to interact with the graph.

The program was run on VTK for python.

Proj2: Force directed graphs
Force directed graphs were developed using webstorm & xampp application.
Files:
nfl data matrix generated from the NFL website in CSV format.

graph 1  is a force directed draggable graph that shows team groups, team names, team location on US map.

graph 2 is draggable too. shows team record in the nfl  standings during the 2020 regular season.

Graph 3 is similar to graph 1 but is not undraggable .

images folder contains images generated from the graphs.

Proj1:
Project one was implemented on Xampp platform and webstorm.
d3, html and svg were used in the implementation
Webstorm interface was chosen in this implementation due to its easy 
connectivity with  d3.js.
Xampp provided a cloud interface to make it easy to run d3.js.
