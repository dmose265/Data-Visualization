Interactive VTK program to exploree iso-surfaces of a volume data set.

Users can interactively define iso-value using a slider (VTK  Slider widget).

1. The CT  Head dataset
2. A 100^3 sampling data set of the quadratic functions x^2 + 0:65y^2 +     0:25z^2 + 0:1xz + 0:2x.

Use the slider to interact with the graph.

The program was run on VTK for python.
